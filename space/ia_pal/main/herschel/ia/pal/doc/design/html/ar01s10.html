There is a common test suite provided such that developers extending the PAL can may verify the integrity of their implementations.
</p><p>
In short, the test suite consists of a single abstract class, CommonPalTestSet,
that pool implementors should extend. This class contains all the test methods that are run as part of the common test suite. The actions of those methods are actually delegated to a method of a PalTestGroup implementation. The design is depicted in <a href="ar01s10.html#figure-common-test-suite" title="Figure&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Class diagram illustrating the design of the common PAL test suite.">Figure&nbsp;4, &ldquo;Class diagram illustrating the design of the common PAL test suite.&rdquo;</a>.

</p><p>
The PAL test harness architecture is admittedly complex, and adding further tests to that suite is complex. But it was felt necessary in order to simplify the work pool implementors need to do in order to implement the common test suite. The problem is that for a test run to report the success of each test method individually, there has to be a method in the pool implementation's test class corresponding to each and every method in the common PAL test suite.</p><p>
 So the choices are for either to have a pool implementor a test method corresponding to each and every method in the common PAL test suite, such that each of those methods delegates its action to that common PAL test suite method, or for the pool implementor to simply extend an abstract test class. The latter is a much more simpler approach.
