As mentioned earlier, ProductPools are the implementations for the persistent storage repositories. 
There are currently a number of different implementations for ProductPools 
(eg file-based such as the SimplePool and lstore implementations; or a database implementation such as the DbPool).
</p><p>
The ProductStorage class provides the central interface for users
and developers alike in terms of accessing products.
This class is the basic storage area, and is created using <pre class="screen">storage=ProductStorage()</pre> 
The product pools that you wish to use need to be registered to the product storage you have created. 
More than one product pool can be registered to a specific ProductStorage.</p><p>

When products are saved, they will be saved to the first pool that registered to the ProductStorage.

Developers are allowed to extend the Product class or any of its subclasses <span class="emphasis"><em>only in Java</em></span>.
Trying to save in a ProductStorage products that belong to a class defined in Jython is not supported.
See also the developer documentation of <a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/SD-general/Projects/Herschel/hscdt/releases/doc/ia/dataset/doc/devel.html#dp.dataset.dg.SpecialDataset.javaonly" target="_top">ia_dataset</a>.

Sometimes what is needed during a session is to have a reference to a product, but not to have to necessarily load it into memory.
This is important if a user needs to reference products of significantly large volumes, but only require, for example attribute information from
each of those products.
</p><p>
The PAL minimizes the memory footprint by introducing the notion of a ProductRef. Access to any product in the PAL
(i.e. via the ProductStorage load() and select() methods) returns not the direct
product or set of products, but instead ProductRef objects that have internal knowledge of that product. 
With a ProductRef, a user is able to access the attribute data, or the meta data of a product,
without loading the complete product in memory. Should the user need to access further information, 
the full contents may be loaded into memory using the ProductRef.getProduct() method.
</p><p>When the referenced product is already saved, and the ProductRef is asked for retrieving it,
it loads and returns the product, but doesn't keep it in memory, unless the product is a Context,
in which case it's kept for further accesses. This mechanism saves space in memory when accessing
heavyweight products.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%">&nbsp;</td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">5.&nbsp;Walk-through&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="pal-guide.html">Home</a></td><td valign="top" align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Associating Products: Contexts</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
