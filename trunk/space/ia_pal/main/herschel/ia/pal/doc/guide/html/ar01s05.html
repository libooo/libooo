This section provides a brief overview of the major components
of the PAL. Most of the components
are illustrated in an example set-up shown in <a href="ar01s05.html#figure-pal-design" title="Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Illustration of PAL components and their usage.">Figure&nbsp;1, &ldquo;Illustration of PAL components and their usage.&rdquo;</a>.

Starting from the left we have a ProductStorage instance. 
This is <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> object end-users and developers 
alike will use to read, write, and search for products. 
The ProductStorage instance accesses data from one or many ProductPools that
are registered with the ProductStorage instance. 
</p><p>
ProductPools are the storage repositories for products. They can have many forms:
file-based, database-based, network-based, and so forth.
</p><p>
Within a pool, products can be grouped together to form associations. 
A special type of Product - a Context - provides for such associations. 
</p><p>
There are two standard implementations of Context available for developers:
ListContext and MapContext. ListContexts provide access to the products they associate by an (integer) index, while a MapContext provides access to it's child products by a (String) key. 
</p><p>
As Contexts themselves are Products, contexts can be referenced from other contexts (in the example, the ListContext is referenced from a MapContext). This can allow, for example, complex hierarchies
of associations to be formed.
</p><p>
It is possible that Contexts present in one ProductPool can reference other products
in other pools (in the example, the ListContext references final product 'Y' in a separate pool).
</p><p>
Contexts reference a product through special constructs called ProductRefs.
These ProductRefs allow for the deferred or lazy loading and saving of Products (thus keeping the memory footprint small) and also enable references 
to Products whose only version is at that current time only
available in memory, or the most recent update is currently available in memory.
(This fairly subtle feature is discussed in more detail in 
<a href="ar01s07.html#context-tree-update" title="7.4.&nbsp;Updating a context 'tree'">Section&nbsp;7.4, &ldquo;Updating a context 'tree'&rdquo;</a>).
</p><p>
What is not shown in the diagram and completes the overview is the query support;
it is possible to perform searches across all the pools pointed to by a ProductStorage,
through one of three types of query objects: AttribQuery 
(which finds matches in product attributes);
MetaQuery (for metadata [as opposed to hard attributes]) of a product; and FullQuery
 (for full searches across all data with a product). 
These are discussed in more detail in section <a href="ar01s12.html" title="12.&nbsp;Querying for products">Section&nbsp;12, &ldquo;Querying for products&rdquo;</a>.
</p><p>
Each of the major components are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
